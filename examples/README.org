    - Eight basic variants of fMRI acquisition planning (slice order × 2, acquisition regime × 2, planning cuboid geometry × 2)
    - Six volumes per sequence, each with head movement around volume(s) =4=, =5= and =6=.
    - Reconstruction matrix: =64×64=
    - =44= slices.
    - =SliceThickness = 3 mm=
    - =SpacingBetweenSlices = 3.3=
  - [[./ge-mr750-pepolarity]]
    - Four acquisitions with flipped phase encoding polarity (=LR=, =RL=, =AP= and =PA=)
